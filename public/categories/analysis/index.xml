      <description>Intro I’ve come across discussion on day-of-week patterns in Bitcoin in various circles, with the most common suggestion being that Bitcoin tends to be higher during the weekdays than on weekend days. Just because somebody says so, doesn’t make it so today, even if it may have been true in the past.
So do any patterns really exist?</description>
